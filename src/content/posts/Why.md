What do we have here?
I'm not sure.
I kind of just created this to stay sharp while on the job hunt. I'm thinking about adding a tutorial on how I made this site, and how you too can put up a blog, on the internet, for free. But why would you want a blog? Can't you post, and tweet (*can* you X?), and gram? Aren't there endless ways to express yourself into the internet? With captive audiences forced to see your thoughts? Yes. So I'm not sure why. Maybe because there's something nostalgic and intimate about reading one. Maybe they're just ways for attention seeking designers and developers to say "look at this thing. I made this thing." Well, take a look.

 The internet is littered with great blogs. Here are a few to scratch your brain: 
* [Manu](https://manuelmoreale.com/)
* [Paco](https://paco.me/)
* [Frank](https://frankchimero.com/)
* [Paul G](https://paulgraham.com/articles.html)
* [Aaron Swartz](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/)
* [Grug](https://grugbrain.dev/) (A personal favorite)
